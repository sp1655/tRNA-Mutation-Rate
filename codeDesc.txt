check_lineup.R
==============
code for checking that the dataset and the assembly line up properly
reads in table of mutations for MA line and genome
makes sure base calls in MA line match those of ref genome


get_tRNA.R
==========
gets only the tRNA data out of the gff3 file and writes to new file


RNAPIII-mutations-functions.R
=============================
functions for analysis of datasets


source_me.R
===========
runs analysis of datasets


tpm.R
=====
finds highly & lowly expressed genes by tpm value in dataset
only works for singular tRNAs - cannot distinguish tpm for multiple
puts results in two files (high & low)


tpm_abundance.R
===============
finds high/low expression cutoffs with tpm and tRNA abundance
didn't use


tpm_strain_conversion.R
=======================
finds coordinates of tRNAs in one strain from another
didn't use after Zhang data was found?


vibrioFiles.R
=============
splits the two vibrio species into two separate datasets
writes mutation files for each species and each condition
